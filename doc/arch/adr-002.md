#ADR002 - Use feign-mock for testing clients

##Context:
Feign clients were created but for testing purposes, is very important to be able to check any status/error code returned by the service, also having a stub response to compare and use as a real service response would improve our test.

##Decision

Will use an open source library feign-mock (https://github.com/velo/feign-mock) for testing purposes.

##Status
Accepted

##Consequences
Application test are improved for feign clients.
