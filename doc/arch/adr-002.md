#ADR002 - Using Spring Cloud Feign

##Context:
The application has as a main requirement to establish communication wth external services such Open Weather Map (https://openweathermap.org/) and Spotify (https://developer.spotify.com/). The communication with these services must be fault tolerable, scalable and testable. 

##Decision

Use a declarative rest client such Feign (https://github.com/OpenFeign/feign) will imprive our application performance with a strong self-explanatory and already tested solution. We will use Spring Cloud Feign module (https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/multi/multi_spring-cloud-feign.html) which uses native Spring MVC annotations for query mapping.

##Status
Accepted

##Consequences
The application consumes external services in the most efficient way.
