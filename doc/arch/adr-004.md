#ADR004 - Implement Redis as client token storage

##Context
Each time Spotify service is execute, a new token is generated. To improve performance, the token should be persisted on lightweight storage system and be retrieved from that source until expiration.

##Decision
One of the most lightweight storage systems is Redis. It also have an implementation to be used with Spring data, so at this moment, is our better choice.

##Status
Accepted

##Consequences
Application saves user token in Redis.
